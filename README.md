# Webhooks

Webhooks are custom HTTP callbacks caused by some events in the system.
When an event occurs in the system, the source site makes a request to the specified URL.

## Webhooks settings

On the portal veriscanonline.com you can set up webhooks on the page
_Settings -> Integration Services -> Webhooks_
or
https://veriscanonline.com/Settings/Webhooks

Events that call web hooks in veriscanonline.com are
* Create History Record;
* Update History Record;
* Sign Agreement
	
Check the checkbox _Active_ and select the necessary events in the panel
_Settings_.
Next, you should create one or more endpoints (up to 5).
Specify the URL which the HTTP request will be executed to 
and check the checkbox _Active_.
Advice. Add a secret parameter to your URL that you are sure that the request came from VeriScan Online system.
	
By default, veriscanonline sends a POST request in JSON format.

}
```

If you use a format other than JSON (XML, SOAP, ...), then you can use Body Template with the tags replaced with values.
For example.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Card xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">  
  <Scanned>%Scanned%</Scanned>
  <IdNum>%IDNum%</IdNum>
  <FirstName>%FirstName%</FirstName>
  <MiddleName>%MiddleName%</MiddleName>
  <LastName>%LastName%LastName>
  <BirthDate>%BirthDate%</BirthDate>
  <ExpDate>%ExpDate%</ExpDate>
  <State>%JurisdictionCode%</State>
  <PostalCode>%PostalCode%</PostalCode>
  <City>%City%</City>
  <Address>%Address%</Address>
  <Gender>%Gender%</Gender>
  <Comments>%Comments%</Comments>
  <Phone>%Phone%</Phone>
  <Email>%Email%</Email>
  <Tags>%Tags%</Tags>
  <GroupName>%GroupName%</GroupName>
  <DeviceName>%DeviceName%</DeviceName>
  <Attachments>%AttachmentLinks%</Attachments>
  <ImageLink>%ImageLink%</ImageLink>  
  <SignatureLink>%SignatureLink%</SignatureLink>
</Card>
```

For each endpoint, you can specify HTTP-header.	
	
For example, you can specify _Content-Type text/xml_ if your endpoint receives data in XML format.
Or you can specify _Authorization Basic bG9naW46cGFzc3dvcmQ=_ (login:password in base64 format), if you use Base64-authorization.

If your endpoint uses the OAuth authentication protocol, then you can save and then use AccessToken and RefreshToken.
	
After you have successfully configured the endpoint and set the necessary settings on our portal, try to scan the card or
sign the agreement or update the card in accordance with the selected events.

### Content
